# Trainer

This repo is for the little "Trainer" app developed as a tool to help students get comfortable performing random combinations

# Use

The app is just HTML, JavaScript and some Audio files stored in a media subfolder.  It will run on most browsers but stick to something Chromium based like Chrome, Edge, Opera etc.  Others should be fine 

# Installation

Just copy the files somewhere (don't forget the audio subfolder) and open the html file.

If you've a git person, use the below

```
git init 
git clone https://github.com/FamilyGojuKarate/Trainer
```

# Dependencies
JavaScript is pretty plain but see the browsers mentioned above
